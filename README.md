# Jupyter Notebook Project

This project contains Jupyter Notebooks for [insert purpose, e.g., data analysis, machine learning, etc.]. The following instructions will help you set up a reproducible Python environment to run the notebooks.

## Project Structure

```
project/
├── notebooks/            # Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files)
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # This file
```

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.12+** (or the appropriate version based on the project)
2. **pip** (comes bundled with Python)

---

## Setting Up the Environment

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment:
- On Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Install the Jupyter Kernel
Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"
```

---

## Running the Notebooks

### 1. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Open the Notebooks
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder in the Jupyter interface.
2. Select the desired notebook (e.g., `analysis.ipynb`).

### 3. Select the Kernel
Ensure the correct kernel (`Python (venv)`) is selected:
- In Jupyter, go to the **Kernel** menu → **Change Kernel** → Select `Python (venv)`.

---

## Notes

- **Environment Reproducibility:** The `requirements.txt` file lists all dependencies. Ensure you use this file to install the exact versions.
- **Jupyter Checkpoints:** `.ipynb_checkpoints/` is automatically created by Jupyter. You don’t need to interact with these files.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Kernel Not Found
If the correct kernel does not appear:
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Reinstall the kernel:
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"
   ```

### Dependencies Not Installing
Make sure you're using the correct Python version (`python --version`) and that the virtual environment is activated.
